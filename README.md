### TermsAndConditions
Version JUL, 2021  

Thank you for your interest in GRIST (Global-to-Regional Integrated forecast SysTem). The developers work hard to create this code. Currently, to obtain the model code in a public approach (e.g., GitHub or Zenodo), a record of user identity and organization is required. This can be done by sending an E-mail with one's GitHub username to grist_dev@163.com; or to join the Ding talk (https://www.dingtalk.com/) group: 33146896 for a request. This Condition does not apply to some special cases such as manuscript review.  

GRIST is provided "as is" and without warranty; without the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.  

Do not distribute the code to any third party. Usage for commercial purposes requires permission.
